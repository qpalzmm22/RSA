# RSA
simple RSA implementation


The p and q must be big enough prime number for RSA to be secure.
This program simply accepts user's input and only check if the numbers are prime or not.
In some cases when the prime numbers are too small, the program will halt because the computer can't generate random number that is smaller than phi(pq).

Also, this program is for HW purpose, therefore the seed for random number generation is fixed(ex: srand(123)).

There are rooms for improvemnets in terms of codes and algorithms.
